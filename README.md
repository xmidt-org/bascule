## Summary

This library provides validation of Tokens used for authorization as well as a 
way to acquire Authorization header values.  Tokens can be parsed and validated 
from http requests. Bascule provides a generic framework that can be configured, 
but currently can support basic and jwt authorization.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it are governed by the [XMiDT Code Of Conduct](https://xmidt.io/code_of_conduct/). 
By participating, you agree to this Code.

## Acquiring Authorization

The `acquire` subpackage handles getting the value for an Authorization header of
an http request.  The JWT acquirer gets a JWT from a configurable endpoint, 
caches it, and will get a new JWT at a configurable time before the current JWT 
expires.

## Validating Authorization

Validation of Tokens happens once an authorization value has been parsed into 
something that implements the [Token interface](https://godoc.org/github.com/xmidt-org/bascule#Token).  
The `basculehttp` subpackage provides http decorators/middleware that will parse an http 
request into a Token and validate it with configurable rules.

Read more about the `basculehttp` subpackage in its [README](basculehttp/README.md).
